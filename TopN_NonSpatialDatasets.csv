To help you compare vehicles from different model years, the fuel consumption ratings for 1995 to 2014 vehicles have been adjusted to reflect the improved testing that is more representative of everyday driving. Note that these are approximate values that were generated from the original ratings, not from vehicle testing.

A positive LMIA must be obtained by an employer before hiring a TFW for a specific occupation.

This list excludes all personal names, such as employers of caregivers or business names that use or include personal names. For this reason, the list is not complete and does not reflect all employers who requested or received an LMIA.

The data provided in this report tracks TFW positions on Labour Market Impact Assessments only, not TFWs that are issued a work permit or who enter Canada. The decision to issue a work permit rests with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC); therefore, not all positions approved result in a work permit or a TFW entering Canada. The data includes all positions on all positive LMIAs as issued, and therefore also includes any position that may have been subsequently cancelled by the employer. For information on the number of work permits issued, please consult Immigration, Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) Facts and Figures: http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/resources/statistics/menu-fact.asp.

Note:
Effective February 2018, Employment and Social Development Canada's (ESDC) Foreign Worker System changed to the LMIA System.
LMIAs in support of Permanent Residence (PR) are excluded from TFWP statistics reporting, unless reported separately. This may impact statistics reported over time.
Country of citizenship information are replaced with country of residence information, reflecting current data collection policies of the LMIA System.

It is important to note that the decision to issue a work permit rests with Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and that not all positions on a positive LMIA result in a work permit. As well, there may also be a time delay between the date the temporary foreign worker (TFW) obtains the work permit and the date they enter Canada. For these reasons, data provided in the LMIA statistics cannot be used to calculate the number of TFWs that have entered or will enter Canada. IRCC publishes annual statistics on the number of foreign workers who enter Canada in its Facts and Figures publication. These statistics are based on the number of work permits issued at ports of entry and encompass a variety of program streams beyond the Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), such as temporary residents entering Canada to work, study or for humanitarian and compassionate reasons. 
Effective February 2018, Employment and Social Development Canada's (ESDC) Foreign Worker System changed to the LMIA System.

In Facts & Figures 2015 for Temporary Residents, numbers on International Mobility Program (IMP) Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes increased due to the moving of the Post-graduate Employment Work Permit Holders population from Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes to Work Permit Holders for Work Purposes under the International Mobility Program. As a result of this, the Facts & Figures 2017 reports reflect a corresponding decrease in the number of Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. These changes have been applied retroactively.

The Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) allows students who have graduated from a participating Canadian post-secondary institution to gain valuable Canadian work experience. Skilled Canadian work experience gained through the PGWPP potentially helps graduates qualify for permanent residence in Canada through the Canadian Experience Class (CEC). 

Facts & Figures 2013 had previously counted those who held Post-Graduation Work Permits as Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes. However, Work Permit Holders for Study Purposes is a category for individuals who are primarily students and who are also allowed to get a work permit (e.g., Co-op students) because it is integral to their course of studies. To get a PGWP, in contrast, an individual must have ceased to be a student – it is a requirement that the individual must have graduated from their program.""

It is a mandatory program for those who meet the requirements.

Facilities that emit 10 kilotonnes or more of GHGs, in carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent (eq.) units, per year must report their emissions to Environment and Climate Change Canada.

Emissions data are available by gas (in tonnes and tonnes of CO2 eq.) for each facility and each year of data collected (2004-Present). The GHGs included are: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC), perfluorocarbons (PFC) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

Note: Data expressed in CO2 eq. units use the most recently revised global warming potential (GWP) values used internationally for GHG reporting.

For this reason, the list is not complete and does not reflect all employers who requested or received an LMIA.

The data provided in this report tracks temporary foreign worker (TFW) positions on negative Labour Market Impact Assessments, which means that the employer did not meet all of the TFWP requirements. 

Overall, if an assessment indicates that hiring a TFW will not have a positive or neutral impact on the Canadian labour market, a negative LMIA will be issued. Specific reasons for a negative assessment could include, but are not limited to:

•the employer was not able to demonstrate a reasonable employment need; 

•the employer has not demonstrated sufficient efforts to recruit, hire or train Canadians or permanent residents for the position;

•the employer did not offer a wage consistent with the occupation being requested; 

•the employer is not adhering to federal/provincial/territorial regulations and/or agreements;

•there is evidence that the entry of a foreign national would impact a pending labour dispute involving Canadians in the requested occupation;

•the employer was not able to demonstrate the ability to fulfil the terms of the job offer;

•the employer was not able to demonstrate that they are actively engaged in the business related to the job offer; and/or

•the employer did not comply with the requirements or conditions set out in previous positive LMIAs and annexes.

Note: 
Effective February 2018, Employment and Social Development Canada's (ESDC) Foreign Worker System changed to the LMIA System.

Departmental data inventories has been published on the Open Government portal, Open.Canada.ca, so that Canadians can see what federal data is collected and have the opportunity to indicate what data is of most interest to them, helping departments to prioritize data releases based on both external demand and internal capacity. 

The objective of the inventory is to provide a landscape of all federal data. While it is recognized that not all data is eligible for release due to the nature of the content, departments are responsible for identifying and including all datasets of business values as part of the inventory exercise with the exception of datasets whose title contains information that should not be released to be released to the public due to security or privacy concerns.  These titles have been excluded from the inventory. 

Departments were provided with an open data inventory template with standardized elements to populate, and upload in the metadata catalogue, the Open Government Registry. These elements are described in the data dictionary file.

The Salmon Escapement Database (NuSEDS) is the DFO Pacific Region’s central database that stores individual spawner survey data records, spawner abundance estimates and the linkages between the two. Annual abundance estimates are maintained by population, as defined by freshwater location and run timing. Each population is referenced to the location of the stream mouth. The watershed-coding system provides unique stream identification and incorporates the natural organization, direction, and hierarchical nature of stream channels and their tributaries.

The NuSEDS database currently reports salmon spawning observations for 9100+ individual populations but escapement estimates (all levels of survey intensity) are available for 9800+ populations. 

This database contains historic population data starting in the 1920’s (older data for some rivers exists in other formats). Prior to 1995 a standardized form (BC-16) was used to summarize the estimate of the spawning population size, but the historical database lacked the capacity to describe the number of observations, individual counts or methods used to estimate the abundance of the population. In 1995, responsibility for salmon enumeration was moved to the DFO Science section. At that time, the database was re-written to include descriptive information for each abundance estimate, providing underlying data and the estimation method(s). Many of the historic estimates prior to 1995 are labeled Unspecified Returns because the database was limited to storing one estimate for any given stock. As time and resources permit these data are being replaced with more accurate categorization. With the introduction of the Wild Salmon Policy (2005), individual populations within NuSEDS can now be grouped by Conservation Unit.",https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/c48669a3-045b-400d-b730-48aafe8c5ee6,1090,1410,3,CSV,2.12501,114

Using information from Canadian industry, academic research and other countries, Government of Canada scientists worked with partners in applying a set of rigorous tools to the 23,000 chemical substances on the Domestic Substances List (DSL). They were categorized to identify those that were:

Inherently toxic to humans or to the environment and that might be:

- Persistent (take a very long time to break down), and/or
- Bioaccumulative (collect in living organisms and end up in the food chain)

Substances to which people might have greatest potential for exposure.

•supporting the development of and tracking progress on air quality management strategies, policies and regulations
•fulfilling Canada’s domestic and international reporting obligations
•informing Canadians about air pollutants emissions
•providing data to support Canada’s air quality health indices

Emissions data is available for the following:

Criteria air contaminants (CACs):
•Total particulate matter (TPM)
•Particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microns (PM10)
•Particulate matter less than or equal to 2.5 microns (PM2.5)
•Sulphur oxides (SOx)
•Nitrogen oxides (NOx)
•Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
•Carbon monoxide (CO)
•Ammonia (NH3)

Heavy metals: 
•Mercury (Hg)
•Lead (Pb)
•Cadmium (Cd)

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs): 
•Dioxins and furans (D/F)
•Four polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) compounds (Benzo[a]pyrene, Benzo[b]fluoranthene, Benzo[k]fluoranthene and Indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene)
•Hexachlorobenzene (HCB)

This data record breaks down the historical trends of reported pollutants by individual substances. To perform more customized selections of APEI data, please visit our website to use our interactive query tool.

The Air Pollutant Emission Inventory is compiled from many different data sources. Emissions data reported by individual facilities to Environment and Climate Change Canada’s National Pollutant Release Inventory are supplemented with well documented, science-based estimation tools to quantify total emissions. Together these data sources provide a comprehensive overview of pollutant emissions across Canada.

The data has been anonymized, where each user on GCconnex is denoted by a random number. The dataset contains every user on GCconnex who has added a ‘colleague’ on the network, (colleague is synonymous with adding a friend on Facebook). When two users on GCconnex add each other as a colleague, a link is drawn between them, demonstrating their connection. This link is known in the data as an edge. Each user who has made a colleague on GCconnex is a node. The date the user created their account, and the department of each user is recorded for each node. The date a colleague connection was made is recorded with the edge.

## Comments
The department of each user on GCconnex is determined either by the user indicating their current department, or, if the user does not indicate their department, by using the suffix of the user’s email. 
Recently, the Government of Canada has commenced an initiative to give select departments the email suffix of @canada.ca. If a GCconnex user has the Canada.ca email suffix, and does not indicate their department, we cannot accurately determine their department. Additionally, if there is a typo in the email address from the user, it becomes difficult to efficiently determine their department if they do not indicate their department themselves.

The commitments include a target to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from federal facilities and fleets:  

 - by 40% compared with 2005 levels by 2030, with an aspiration to
   achieve this target by 2025  
 - by 80% compared with 2005 levels by 2050 (with an aspiration to be
   carbon neutral)  

The target supports Canada’s climate goals, which are already established:  

 - under the Paris Agreement on climate change  
 - in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change  
 - in the Federal Sustainable Development Strategy  

The Government of Canada tracks its energy use and its GHG emissions across 25 departments and agencies. As of fiscal year 2018-19, we have reduced GHG emissions from federal operations reported under the target by 32.6% from 2005 levels.

Sources of the Government of Canada’s GHG emissions are the energy used for its facilities (89%) and its fleet (11%):  

- facilities comprise office space, defence bases, laboratories and warehouses
- fleets comprise on-road vehicles and off-road fleets, including cars, vans, trucks, boats, ships and planes

Certain sources of GHG emissions are excluded from the federal emissions reduction target because of their important role in ensuring the national safety and security of all Canadians. Federal organizations that exclude national safety and security emissions from the reduction target are still required to:

- track and report emissions related to national safety and security
- take steps to reduce these emissions

Moving forward, the Government of Canada will gather and share information from more federal organizations and from additional sources of GHG emissions. Doing so will allow for more open, transparent and complete reporting of federal GHG emissions. New open datasets from 2018-19 include:

- energy and GHG reporting from Public Health Agency of Canada, Canadian Food Inspection Agency, Library and Archives Canada and Canadian Security Intelligence Service
- Facility-level energy consumption
- GHG emissions from federal employee work-related air travel
- GHG emissions from national safety and security operations

Please note that some year-to-year changes in GHG emissions may be due to data collection gaps, methodology or error correction refinements, while others may be the result of one-time or specific events or actions (such as natural disasters or operational disruptions). Additionally, variations in seasonal weather conditions (for example, the effect of heating or cooling days on building energy use) also influence annual GHG emissions.",https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/6bed41cd-9816-4912-a2b8-b0b224909396,496,640,3,CSV,5.0,1

A methodological note on the cumulative CLB file
- as of December 12, 2018

The cumulative CLB file is an update of the CLB data from consecutive editions of the Quarterly National CLB report by Forward Sortation Area (FSA).  The current file is updated using CLB data from the last four quarters (Q4 2017 through to Q3 2018) that can be found in the Q3 2018 National CLB report. The Q3 2018 report also contains the updated FSA values from the August 2018 release of Statistics Canada’s Postal Code Conversion File.  In this edition four new FSA values (G3S, H4Y, R5K, and V8E) were created and four FSA values (H4Z, H5A, N8V, and S4K) were removed. Updates of the historical and recent CLB data, in the cumulative file, are adjusted to reflect the new and old FSA values. All counts of 30 or under are not included and are represented with an asterisk in the Quarterly National CLB report by FSA. The Quarterly National CLB report by FSA presents CLB data by FSA and does not include the CLB aggregated data at either the national or province and territory levels. 

Also the primary source of data that is used to produce the Quarterly National CLB report by FSA and update the cumulative file comes from the Canada Education Savings Program’s administrative data.  Some updates (e.g., reversals, repayments, data errors, and reporting delays) may have been introduced in the Canada Education Savings Program’s administrative data that could affect the previous reporting periods. As a result, the values in the latest quarterly report supersede the previous quarterly reports.

The suitcase-sized NEOSSat orbits at an altitude of approximately 780 kilometres above the Earth, searching for near-Earth asteroids that are difficult to spot using ground-based telescopes. Because of its lofty location, it is not limited by the day-night cycle and can operate 24/7. It circles the globe every 100 minutes, and, in part due to its large baffle, is able to scan space near the Sun in order to detect asteroids that may someday pass close to Earth. Through NEOSSat, Canada is participating in the international effort of the world’s space agencies to catalogue the near-Earth population of asteroids and produce information that can be used to target new destinations for future space exploration missions.

The InFORM is a collaborative radiation monitoring network aimed at assessing and communicating the potential environmental impact   to the Canada’s Pacific and Arctic Oceans stemming from the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear accident (http://fukushimainform.wordpress.com).  InFORM includes government agencies (Health Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada), academics (University of Victoria, University of Ottawa), the private sector (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution), and citizen scientists. 
Health Canada also measured the radiological content of various fish and seafood products as part of the Canadian Total Diet Study (TDS). The TDS provides estimated levels of exposure to chemicals that Canadians in different age-sex groups may accumulate through the food supply. More information on the TDS can be found here: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/surveill/total-diet/index-eng.php
All of Health Canada's measurements indicate that the radiological content of west coast fish are dominated by natural radionuclides (e.g. potassium-40 and polonium-210), and that the level of anthropogenic radionuclides, including the one resulting from the Fukushima nuclear accident, are very small in comparison (typically below our detection limit of ~1Bq/kg).  Detailed information on radiation from Japan, including radiation levels in food products, seafood, and ocean water, can be found here: http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hc-ps/ed-ud/respond/nuclea/add_info-ren_supp-eng.php.

743a0b4a-9e33-4b12-981a-9f9fd3dd1680,Parks Canada,Human-wildlife conflict incidents managed by Parks Canada,"This Open Data Record is comprised of datasets that document human-wildlife conflict incidents managed by Parks Canada Agency. A human-wildlife conflict (HWC) “incident” is any potential conflict situation between people and wildlife that was assigned to Parks Canada staff to manage to help ensure the safety and wellbeing of people and wildlife. The vast majority of HWC incidents are minor and staff are able to manage them safely with low risk to people, however, the dataset also includes more hazardous incidents between people and wildlife that can result in injury or death of either wildlife or people. 

HWC incident data inform Parks Canada Agency policies, programs, and operations, and enable evaluation of HWC patterns to help Parks Canada ensure safe and enjoyable visitor experiences while conserving wildlife and integrity of ecosystems across our national system of protected heritage areas.

For any single HWC incident, there may be multiple management actions taken or multiple animals involved, and therefore this Open Data Record includes separate datasets for incidents, responses, animals involved, and human activities. These four datasets include many shared fields, including a unique alphanumeric “Incident Number” that can be used to look-up records between the tables or to join the tables in a relational database. There are also nine derived datasets provided to summarize the total number of incidents, animal species involved, animals injured or killed (by human causes), aggressive encounters, unnatural attractants, and response actions taken. 

All HWC incident data remain subject to ongoing revisions as more information comes available or for quality control purposes. All protected, personal, private or confidential information has been removed from these datasets.

81cc47ac-e88d-4b7f-9318-8774a2d919e6,Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada,Financial transaction report counts by postal code and activity sector,"##Report Volume Data

The report counts in this data set are broken down by activity sector, report type, the year and month of receipt, and reporting entity location. 

The reporting entity location is represented by the forward sortation area (FSA) component of the Canadian postal code (i.e. the first three characters of the Canadian postal code, e.g. “K1P”) that designates the postal district where the reporting entity is located.

##Protecting the Identity of Reporting Entities

By law, FINTRAC must protect the identity of the persons and entities that are required to submit financial transaction reports to the Centre under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.  In keeping with this responsibility to protect information, FINTRAC cannot provide more specific geographic data than is contained in this data set. 

Whenever possible, the data set includes the full FSA to identify the location of reporting entities submitting reports to FINTRAC. However, in any case where a certain location contains fewer than five reporting entities, only partial characters of the FSA are shown. This means that certain FSAs may contain only one or two characters (e.g. K or K1) instead of the standard three characters (e.g. K1P). In rare cases, it was not possible to provide a reporting entity location without risking revealing the identity of reporting entities in a given activity sector and so the data is provided at a national level only.

All FSA levels are hierarchically inclusive. This means, for example, that the total number of report counts for K1 includes all reports submitted within all FSAs that start with K1 (i.e. K1A, K1B, K1C), including those that may not be visible because they include fewer than five reporting entities in a given activity sector.
